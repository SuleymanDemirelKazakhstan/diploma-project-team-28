## Goals
* What is the purpose of this project?
 A multi-user platform where users can chat, debate, hold official meetings, or just relax and spend time with friends while watching movies or listening to music together. Our platform has a modern and user-friendly design, where users can stream and promote their products, and can also gather for a formal meeting. The platform will have several rooms, which the user himself will add and will navigate using the sidebar. On the main page, he can also find recommendations for channels, topics that interest him.
 
* What are the problems it will solve?
 As mentioned above, this platform is for fast and convenient communication, where people according to their preference can find themselves a “room” for communication. On the platform, it will be possible to find new and interesting acquaintances, hold a business meeting, contact relatives and friends, and it will also be possible to stream. The account profile will contain information about the user, as well as links to other sources where you can learn more about the person. It will be possible to promote your business and show your skills and talent. Basically, the rooms will all be open and anyone can join, but it will be possible to create a private room where, for example, only relatives and the like will sit. Answering the question why this platform is needed? The world two years ago was faced with a virus that is still spreading and people were required to stay at home. At the moment, online communication is now very relevant for work or for a conversation with loved ones, in our platform it will be possible to visualize and feel the real atmosphere of the environment for which the meeting will be created.

* How will it streamline or improve the current process or facilitate a new process?
* This product is aimed at the digital industry. Product teams, companies specializing in organizing online events, conferences can use this application as the main tool for their activities.
